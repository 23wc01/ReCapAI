# ReCapAI
Freshman year's 1st ChatGPT API project &amp; 1st hackathon project. Utilized GPT3.5 LLM to perform summarizing (recapping), sentiment analysis, keypoints extraction, action items extraction of an audio file and save AI responses into a word docx.

# Run
Run .ipynb file and EarningCalls.wav's full "recap" should be created in your local folder as a file name "recap.docx". 

# Project Progress
Due to the short 2-day time limit at [TigerHacks2023](https://mizzoutigerhacks2023.devpost.com/), the program could only create a recap for 1 specific audio file. Although that was enough to achieve 1st place in my category, there are definitely more improvements to be made. *OpenAI has since updated its API, thus, I will also make code changes accordingly

# Maintainence
This independent project will continue to be updated upon by me. I plan to improve the project so that audio files of any length can be "recapped".

# Source
This project is mainly derived from ChatGPT API's tutorial: https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/meeting-minutes

Additional sources used are listed in .ipynb file.
